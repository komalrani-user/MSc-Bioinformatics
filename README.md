# MSc-Bioinformatics
A collection of projects and code developed during my MSc in Bioinformatics.

**Statistics and Data Analytics:**
1. Simulating Markov Chains
2. Data Analysis  
  a) Principal Component Analysis  
  b) Expression Analysis

**Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing:**  
DEG & Pathway Analysis  
1. Identify the Differentially expressed genes between sensitive vs resistant samples.
2. Identify which KEGG pathways are up- or down-regulated in sensitive samples and in samples demonstrating resistance.
3. What genes are important? What pathways could you identify?
