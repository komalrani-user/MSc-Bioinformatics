# MSc-Bioinformatics
A collection of projects and code developed during my MSc in Bioinformatics.

**Statistics and Data Analytics:**
1. Simulating Markov Chains
2. Data Analysis  
  a) Principal Component Analysis  
  b) Expression Analysis

**Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing:**  
DEG & Pathway Analysis  
1. Identifying Differentially expressed genes between sensitive vs resistant samples.
2. Identifying KEGG pathways that are up-or down-regulated in sensitive samples and in the samples demonstrating resistance.
3. Identifying important genes and pathways.

**Data Analytics & Statistical Machine Learning:**
- Pre-processing: data filtering, data imputation, Encoding, Scaling, Class balancing(SMOTE).    
- Unsupervised Learning: PCA, tSNE, Kmeans clustering, Hierarchical clustering.
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression Classifier.

Metabolomics:
- Reproducible Workflow and Analysis in Galaxy
- Partial Least SquaresÂ Discriminant Analysis
- Metabolite Annotation
