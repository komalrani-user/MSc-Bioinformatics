# MSc-Bioinformatics
A collection of projects and code developed during my MSc in Bioinformatics.

**Statistics and Data Analytics:**
1. Simulating Markov Chains
2. Data Analysis  
  a) Principal Component Analysis  
  b) Expression Analysis

**Genomics and Next Generation Sequencing:**  
DEG & Pathway Analysis  
1. Identifying Differentially expressed genes between sensitive vs resistant samples.
2. Identifying KEGG pathways that are up-or down-regulated in sensitive samples and in the samples demonstrating resistance.
3. Identifying important genes and pathways.

**Data Analytics & Statistical Machine Learning:**
- Pre-processing: data filtering, data imputation, Encoding, Scaling, Class balancing(SMOTE).    
- Unsupervised Learning: PCA, tSNE, Kmeans clustering, Hierarchical clustering.
- Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression Classifier.

**Metabolomics:**
- Reproducible Workflow and Analysis in Galaxy
- Partial Least SquaresÂ Discriminant Analysis
- Metabolite Annotation

**Computational Biology:**
Exploring the effect of polar organic compounds with in vivo bioassay (neonates of Daphnia magna).  
Research Goals:  
- How does the individual omics level change over different locations (D01-D12), concentration levels (Control, 1x, 10x), and their interactions?  
- How do the interactions between the multiple omics levels change over different locations, concentration levels, and their interactions?  
- How does the change relate to the distribution of detected individual organic chemical compounds? Which chemical may cause the most significant adverse outcome on the Daphnia?  
- What biological/environmental insights can you obtain from your data analysis findings?
